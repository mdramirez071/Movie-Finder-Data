This project is called "Movie Finder Data" for module NODE101.

The goal of this project was to accomplish the following:

1. Make a request to grab the Movie Data from OMDB's Database Server.
2. Once the data is grabbed, cache the Movie Data into a separate Cache Server/Object.
3. Once the data is cached, perform tests to make sure you can grab data from either the actual OMDB Server or the Cache Server itself.

How to Demo this project:

Clone the repository locally to your computer. Open up the project in Visual Studio Code. Open up Terminal, run the command "npm test" //This will run a set of tests inside the Terminal to see whether or not the server can reach out to the OMDB Database to grab the specify Movie Data (i.e. grab the information for "Baby Driver" and "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2."). Once the tests are ran, simply close out the project.
